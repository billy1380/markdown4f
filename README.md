# markdown4f

A markdown library for Flutter.

## Port

Currently this is a incomplete port of [markdown4j-gwt](https://github.com/billy1380/markdown4j-gwt). The aim is for it to transform markdown to Widgets. The initial version transforms markdown to HTML.

## Motivation

I am doing this because the current libraries for flutter are far too finikey about the quality of the markdown and that is causing issues in one of the applications I am writing.
